Flags:
-----
+NOGRAVITY          = Actor is not subject to gravity.
                      * Automatically given by the Projectile combo.
+NOBLOCKMAP         = This object is excluded from passive collision detection.
                      Nothing else can run into a NOBLOCKMAP object but the
					  object itself can run into others.
				      * Automatically given by the Projectile combo
+NOINTERACTION      = The actor is purely decorative. It will not interact with
                      any other actor and will ignore all game physics
					  (including solid walls and floors!), moving only
					  according to its own momentum. (i.e. The actor will not
					  be affected by gravity, but its movement can still be
					  directly changed using ThrustThing.) All AI routines
					  will ignore this actor's existence, speeding up
					  processing time.
+DONTSPLASH         = Actor does not create any terrain splashes.
+NONETID            = Actors with this flag are not assigned a network id when
                      spawned. Only use it if you know what you are doing!
+CLIENTSIDEONLY     = Spawns the actor on the clientside no matter how it is
                      spawned.
